### **Real-Time Collaboration Tool**


### **Overview**


This project is a Real-Time Collaboration Tool that enables multiple users to edit a shared document simultaneously. Using WebSockets, the application ensures real-time synchronization across connected clients, allowing seamless collaboration. The project is designed as a web-based text editor where users can modify the content in real-time, and the updates are instantly reflected for all connected users.

### **Tools & Technologies Used**


#### **Backend:**


- **Node.js & Express.js** - Manages the server-side logic and WebSocket connections.


- **WebSocket (ws)** - Provides real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.


- **CORS Middleware** - Allows cross-origin requests to support frontend-backend interaction.


#### **Frontend:**


- **React.js** - Used to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.


- **Tailwind CSS** - Ensures a visually appealing and responsive design.


- **React Hooks (useState, useEffect)** - Manages state and WebSocket interactions.


#### **Development Tools:**


- **VS Code** - Used as the primary code editor for development.


- **Git & GitHub** - For version control and project submission.


---


### **Features**


- **Multi-User Collaboration** - Allows multiple users to edit the same document in real-time.


- **WebSocket-Based Synchronization** - Ensures instant updates across all connected clients.


- **Simple & Intuitive UI** - Provides a user-friendly text editor for collaborative editing.


- **Error Handling** - Ensures smooth operation with error detection and handling.


- **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly on different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.

### **Application Flow**


1. **User Connects to the Application** - The user opens the application and establishes a WebSocket connection.


2. **Document Synchronization** - The current document state is sent to the newly connected user.


3. **Real-Time Editing** - Any change made by a user is broadcasted to all other connected clients instantly.


4. **Live Updates** - The document updates dynamically as users type, ensuring a synchronized experience.
